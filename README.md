# ThingSpeak IoT Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **ThingSpeak**, an open-source IoT analytics platform, for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing sensor data. The system utilizes **ThingSpeak's cloud capabilities** to process real-time data from sensors connected via a 5G communication network.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Sensors send real-time data to ThingSpeak using HTTP/MQTT protocols.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize data using dynamic graphs and charts on the ThingSpeak dashboard.
- **Data Processing**: Perform advanced analytics using MATLAB integrated with ThingSpeak.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Generate alerts based on predefined conditions.
- **Integration**: Use APIs to integrate ThingSpeak data with other applications or workflows.

## Components Used
- **Sensors**: [List of sensors used, e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.]
- **Microcontroller/Hardware**: [e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP32]
- **Communication**: 5G network for high-speed and low-latency data transmission.
- **ThingSpeak**: IoT platform for data storage, processing, and visualization.

## Prerequisites
1. **ThingSpeak Account**: [Sign up here](https://thingspeak.com/).
2. **ThingSpeak Channel**: Create a channel and configure the required fields for your sensors.
3. **Hardware and Sensors**: Set up your sensors and microcontroller for data collection.
4. **MATLAB**: Integrated for advanced data analysis (can be accessed via the ThingSpeak web interface).

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Create a ThingSpeak Channel
- Log in to your ThingSpeak account.
- Create a new channel.
- Define fields corresponding to your sensor data (e.g., Field 1: Temperature, Field 2: Humidity).

### 2. Connect Sensors to ThingSpeak
- Use the provided **HTTP/MQTT API** to send data to ThingSpeak.
- Example of sending data using HTTP:
  ```http
  https://api.thingspeak.com/update?api_key=YOUR_WRITE_API_KEY&field1=25.6&field2=60
### 3. Write MATLAB Code
  Use MATLAB for processing and analyzing data. 
  Example:
    matlab
    Copy
    Edit
channelID = 123456; % Replace with your Channel ID
readAPIKey = 'YOUR_READ_API_KEY'; % Replace with your Read API Key
data = thingSpeakRead(channelID, 'Fields', [1, 2], 'NumPoints', 10, 'ReadKey', readAPIKey);
plot(data);

### Usage
*Data Collection*: Sensors send data to ThingSpeak channels over the 5G network.
*Data Processing*: Use ThingSpeak's MATLAB integration to process and analyze data.
*Visualization*: View real-time data visualizations on the ThingSpeak dashboard.
*Alerts and Notifications*: Set triggers for email or webhook notifications.
**Example Project Workflow**
*Temperature Monitoring:*

Sensors collect temperature data.
ThingSpeak stores and processes the data.
Alerts are sent if temperature exceeds a threshold.
Environmental Analysis:

Monitor multiple parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure).
Analyze trends and predict future conditions using MATLAB.
